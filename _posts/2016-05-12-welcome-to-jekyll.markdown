1. Selenium Grid is used to run automation scripts on different versions of browser, OS etc.

2. Selenium grid will have one Hub(like a server) and multiple nodes.

3.To run the scripts on VM's, remote webdriver(a Class) is used. Information is passed from local   machine to the Hub on the desired capabilities(OS,Browser,version).

4. Communication from the hub to nodes happen via JSON wire/HTTP.

5. RemoteWebDriver is an implementation class of the WebDriver interface that a test script developer can use to execute their test scripts via the RemoteWebDriver server on a remote machine.

6.The desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browsername, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behaviour of the browser at run time
